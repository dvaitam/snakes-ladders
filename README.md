On load, you'll be prompted for your name. Click **Roll Dice** to play. A board can be played solo or with multiple players. Each board is identified by a unique ID in the URL.

Snakes are drawn as colourful zigâ€‘zag lines and ladders appear as two parallel brown lines on the board. Each player is represented with a different coloured marker.
